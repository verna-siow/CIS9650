# Problem Statement
Cardiovasular disease is one of the popular reasons that leads to death. This project is designed to find the chance of getting cardiovascualr disease based on user's information, correlations of potential causes and analysis of key driven factors for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the this project is to raise awareness and better inform users about their health in order to take preventative actions.

# Dataset
The data used in this project is from: https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset

# Analysis
Through our model, users can see that the top three driven factors are cholesterol, active level and gender. The highlight of our model is the prediction of getting cardiovascular disease by inputing person's age, gender, height, weight, cholesterol level, glucose level and lifestyle ( smoke, drink alcohol and work out). The model would show the percentage of that person getting cardio disease.

# Instructions
Please refer to the user manual.
